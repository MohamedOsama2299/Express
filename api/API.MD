# What is an API?

An **API (Application Programming Interface)** is a structured way that allows two programs to communicate with each other without needing to know each other's internal details.

An API usually works like this:

## How API Works

### 1️⃣ Client (The requester)
This could be:
- A browser  
- A mobile app  
- The Frontend  

### 2️⃣ Request
The client sends a request to the server.

### 3️⃣ Server (The executor)
The server receives the request and processes it.

### 4️⃣ Response
The server sends back a response, usually in **JSON** format.

# REST API

The most common type of API.

It is based on HTTP methods:

- **GET** → Retrieve data  
- **POST** → Create data  
- **PUT** → Update data  
- **DELETE** → Remove data

# Why is API Important?

- Separates Frontend and Backend  
- Allows systems to communicate with each other  
- Makes development easier  
- Makes the project scalable  
- Lets you change the frontend without changing the backend
