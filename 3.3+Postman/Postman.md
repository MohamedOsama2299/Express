# Postman Benefits

## 1. Testing the API before building Frontend

Instead of creating web pages just to see the data, you can send requests to the API and see responses directly.

## 2. Testing different types of requests

- **GET** → Retrieve data
- **POST** → Send new data
- **PUT/PATCH** → Modify data
- **DELETE** → Remove data
